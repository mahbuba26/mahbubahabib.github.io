## Projects
**Online Food Ordering**

Successfully delivered in-depth health information including Body Mass Index (BMI), Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), and customized calorie requirements through the creation of a user-focused Android app using Java. This accomplishment was made possible by emphasizing user-friendly design and ease of access. Furthermore, achieved accurate monitoring and management of data within the app, ensuring precise tracking of users' daily calorie consumption, through the skillful implementation of a specific feature. This success was a result of meticulous attention to detail and proficient use of Java programming skills.[(Details in Github)](https://github.com/mahbuba26/FoodAppNew)
